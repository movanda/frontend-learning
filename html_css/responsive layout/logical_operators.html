      [not] must be written in front of the media type!
      When [not] and [and] appear together and there is no other query logic,
      then [not] negates the entire condition. That is: negate the current condition.

      This means: Except for the size other than (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 375px),
      the rest of the background color is skyblue */

      /*
      POINT
      In the following case, [not] does not negate all,
      but only negates the preceding one up to the comma.

      It means: the minimum size of the screen is not 500px, or the screen is horizontal,
      as long as one of them is satisfied, the background color is slateblue.
